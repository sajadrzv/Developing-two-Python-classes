# Developing-two-Python-classes
Developed two Python classes to check four linearity assumptions for any preprocessed data set and to determine suitable machine learning models for regression problemsDeveloped
In this project we developed two classes :
• 1st Class: automatically checks all four linearity assumptions for any data set
This Class takes the dataset and response variable and automatically checks all the assumptions.
• 2nd Class: selecting the right model by applying ML models.
Eleven regression algorithms were integrated into the model selection class. The two parameters needed to run the class successfully are the name of the dataset of interest and the name of the response variable. The best model will be selected by trying different models and analyzing the results (RMSE and linearity assumptions)
